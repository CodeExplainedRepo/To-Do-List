Based on the preview job, I have added two functions. The first one when double click the item you can edit the content of to-do-list and the changes will auto save when the content lose the focus. The second one is that you can see the lists sorted by their completion.

You can see the result in https://kkkinlibrary.github.io/To-Do-List/
